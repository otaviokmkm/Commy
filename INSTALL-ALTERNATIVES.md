# Alternative SpacetimeDB Installation Methods

## The Direct Installation URLs seem to be having issues. Let's try these alternative approaches:

### Method 1: Winget (Best option for Windows 10/11)
```cmd
winget install clockworklabs.spacetimedb
```

### Method 2: Scoop Package Manager
If you have Scoop installed:
```cmd
scoop install spacetimedb
```

### Method 3: Using Git + Cargo (Build from source)
If you have Rust installed:
```cmd
git clone https://github.com/clockworklabs/SpacetimeDB.git
cd SpacetimeDB
cargo install --path crates/cli
```

### Method 4: Official Installer Script (Modified for Windows)
Use PowerShell to run:
```powershell
# Download and run the installation script
Invoke-WebRequest -UseBasicParsing -Uri "https://install.spacetimedb.com" | Invoke-Expression
```

### Method 5: Manual Download
1. Go to: https://github.com/clockworklabs/SpacetimeDB/releases
2. Find the latest release
3. Download the Windows executable file
4. Place it in a folder like `C:\spacetimedb\`
5. Add that folder to your PATH

### Method 6: Using WSL (Windows Subsystem for Linux)
If you have WSL installed:
```bash
curl --proto '=https' --tlsv1.2 -sSf https://install.spacetimedb.com | sh
```

## Quick Test Commands
After installation, test with:
```cmd
spacetime --version
spacetime help
```

## If All Else Fails
We can also create a simplified MMORPG using just Node.js + Socket.IO but with a much cleaner architecture than before. SpacetimeDB is ideal, but we have backup options!
